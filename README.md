# ML@LSE Bootcamps - Michaelmas Term 2018

### Bootcamp Taster Session & Get to Know the Committee - 26 September 2018, PAR2.03

This will be a great opportunity for all students who are interested to get involved with ML@LSE to get to know the committee as well as the slew of events we have lined up for the upcoming Academic Year. 

As we only have one hour, we will try to focus on:
1. A gentle introduction to machine learning with interactive visualisations and interesting use cases
2. Sharing of the events we have lined up for the term ahead such as our pioneering Industry Mentorship Programme with Datatonic, as well as what our bootcamp expects to cover
3. Getting to know what people are interested in so that we can improve upon our activities 

4. If there is time and/or demand, we may also do a short interactive activity on how we can build a highly accurate image classifier for the MNIST digits dataset in < 500 lines of code. 

The machine learning wave is coming, so join us to ride the wave!
