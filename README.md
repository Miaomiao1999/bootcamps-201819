### [Bootcamp Taster Session & Get to Know the Committee - 26 September 2018, PAR2.03](/give-it-a-go)

This will be a great opportunity for all students who are interested to get involved with ML@LSE to get to know the committee as well as the slew of events we have lined up for the upcoming Academic Year. 

As we only have one hour, we will try to focus on:
1. A gentle introduction to machine learning with interactive visualisations and interesting use cases
2. Sharing of the events we have lined up for the term ahead such as our pioneering Industry Mentorship Programme with Datatonic, as well as what our bootcamp expects to cover
3. Getting to know what people are interested in so that we can improve upon our activities 

4. If there is time and/or demand, we may also do a short interactive activity on how we can build a highly accurate image classifier for the MNIST digits dataset in < 500 lines of code. 

The machine learning wave is coming, so join us to ride the wave!

### [Bootcamp 1: Introduction to Machine Learning - 10 October 2018, 1600 - 1800, PAR.LG.03](/Bootcamp%201)

This first workshop aims to cover the general principles of machine learning theories and techniques. 

We also aim to help out with the installation of the Jupyter Notebook development environment, which we will be using as our implementation environment for all subsequent bootcamps. 

If time permits, we may also introduce some of the packages that we will be using frequently for subsequent bootcamps, such as pandas, numpy and sklearn.

**Objectives:** Understand the basics concepts and notions underpinning machine learning theories and techniques.

**Requirements:** Basic definitions of random variable, expectation and variance. Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra may be useful.

**Keywords:** Dataset, Number of Observations, Dimensionality, Machine learning techniques, High dimensional statistics, Statistical pattern, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning, Learning Function, Inputs and Outputs, Training Data, Test Data, Irreducible Error, Regression, Classification, Loss, Risk, Empirical Risk, MSE, MER, Testing Errors, Overfitting, Generalization, Training vs. Testing Errors, Bias- Variance Trade-off.


**What is Anaconda?** 
Anaconda is a python and R distribution. It aims to provide everything you need (python wise) for data science "out of the box".
It includes:
- The core python language
- 100+ python "packages" (libraries)
- Spyder (IDE/editor - like pycharm) and Jupyter

### Bootcamp 2: Tree-Based Methods

### Bootcamp 3: Support Vector Machines 

### Bootcamp 4: Introduction to Unsupervised Learning Methods

_Details about whatever is covered by each session will be released as we develop this repository_
